# SOIBV
J2EE-based web application to handle membership and operations for churches, integrated with MySQL. It includes basic CRUD operations, reports, and Primefaces as the front-end framework. This system helped churches to stop gathering member data using physical forms, and have a detailed insight and statistics of their members.
